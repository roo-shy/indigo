<p>I'm Rooshee. I'm 34 designer and engineer. I'm Russian live in Houston, TX. Iâ€™ve worked internationally, in-house and remotely on projects for leading brands, startups and non-profits. UX and tech problem solving are central to everything I do. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful and beautiful products that help people and make a difference. I like to be involved at different stages of a developing process from issuing a ticket to QA testing to opening a pull a request.
